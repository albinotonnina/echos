# Installing EchOS

EchOS can be installed in several ways, from a one-line command to manual git clone.

---

## Quick Install (Recommended)

### One-liner (macOS + Linux)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/albinotonnina/echos/main/install.sh | bash
```

This script will:
1. Install Node.js 20+ via Homebrew / apt / dnf if not present
2. Install pnpm if not present
3. Clone the repository
4. Install dependencies (prebuilt native modules, no C++ toolchain needed)
5. Build all packages
6. Launch the setup wizard

**Environment overrides:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ECHOS_INSTALL_DIR` | `./echos` | Installation directory |
| `ECHOS_BRANCH` | `main` | Git branch to checkout |
| `ECHOS_NON_INTERACTIVE` | `0` | Set to `1` to skip the wizard |

---

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew tap albinotonnina/echos
brew install echos
```

The formula:
- Installs Node.js 20 and Redis as dependencies
- Builds all packages with prebuilt native modules
- Registers a launchd service for auto-start

After installing:

```bash
echos-setup                # opens browser-based setup wizard
brew services start echos  # start the daemon
echos "search my notes"    # use the CLI
```

---

### Docker

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
```

Docker handles all dependencies (Node.js, Redis) in containers. See [Deployment](https://docs.echos.sh/deployment) for full Docker setup.

---

## Manual Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/albinotonnina/echos.git && cd echos
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

---

## Setup Wizard

After installation, configure EchOS with one of these methods:

### Browser-based Setup (Recommended)

```bash
pnpm wizard
```

Opens `http://localhost:3456` with a guided wizard that walks you through:
- API keys (Anthropic required, OpenAI optional)
- Telegram bot configuration
- Feature toggles (Web UI)
- Redis connection

### CLI Setup

```bash
pnpm wizard:cli
```

Interactive terminal wizard with the same configuration steps.

### Non-interactive Setup

```bash
# Set environment variables, then:
pnpm wizard:cli --non-interactive
```

Reads from environment variables and writes `.env` without prompts. Useful for CI/automation.

---

## Dependencies

### Required
- **Node.js 20+** — runtime
- **pnpm 10+** — package manager
- **Redis** — background scheduler (digests, reminders, cron jobs)

### What you DON'T need
- **No C++ toolchain** — all native modules (better-sqlite3, LanceDB, sharp) ship prebuilt binaries
- **No Python** — YouTube transcript extraction uses a pure JavaScript library

---

## Native Modules

EchOS uses three native Node.js modules, all with prebuilt binary support:

| Module | Used For | Prebuilt Strategy |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| `better-sqlite3` | Metadata database | `prebuild-install` (prebuilt binaries for all platforms) |
| `@lancedb/lancedb` | Vector search | Platform-specific optional deps (`@lancedb/lancedb-darwin-arm64`, etc.) |
| `sharp` | Image processing | Platform-specific optional deps (`@img/sharp-darwin-arm64`, etc.) |

No compilation is needed on macOS (ARM64/x64), Linux (x64/ARM64), or Windows.

---

## Starting EchOS

```bash
# Start the daemon (Telegram + Web interfaces)
pnpm start

# Start with pretty-printed logs
pnpm start | pnpm exec pino-pretty

# Use the CLI (no daemon needed)
pnpm echos "what did I save yesterday?"
```

---

## Updating

```bash
# If installed via install.sh or git clone
cd echos
git pull
pnpm install
pnpm build

# If installed via Homebrew
brew upgrade echos
```

---

## Future Distribution Methods

These are planned but not yet implemented:

- **Tauri desktop app** — `.dmg` for macOS with menu bar icon and auto-updates
- **Docker Desktop Extension** — one-click install from Docker Hub
- **npm global package** — `npm install -g echos`
