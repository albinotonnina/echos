# Tools Reference

EchOS is an agent, not a command-line app. You don't call tools directly — you just talk to it, and it decides which tools to use. This page tells you what's possible so you know what to ask for.

Tools are split into two groups:

- **Core tools** — always available, built into the agent
- **Plugin tools** — enabled by config, extend the agent with new capabilities

---

## Core tools

### Notes

#### Create a note

**Tool:** `create_note`

Save anything as a note — thoughts, research, meeting notes, journal entries, ideas. Notes are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, indexed for full-text and semantic search.

```
Save a note: I want to learn Rust this year, starting with the book.
Write a journal entry about today's standup.
Note this down: the API rate limit is 100 req/min per user.
```

Supports types: `note` (default) and `journal`. You can also provide tags and a category.

---

#### Read a note

**Tool:** `get_note`

Retrieve the full content of a specific note by its ID.

```
Show me note abc-123.
What does note xyz-456 say?
```

---

#### List notes

**Tool:** `list_notes`

Browse your notes — optionally filtered by type, read status, or date range.

```
List my recent notes.
Show me all my journal entries from last week.
What articles have I saved but not read yet?
List notes from January.
```

---

#### Update a note

**Tool:** `update_note`

Change the title, content, tags, or category of an existing note.

```
Update note abc-123 — add the tag "important".
Change the title of note xyz to "Q1 Planning".
Append this to note abc-123: [text]
```

---

#### Delete a note

**Tool:** `delete_note`

Permanently remove a note from storage and all indexes.

```
Delete note abc-123.
Remove that note I just saved.
```

---

#### Search your knowledge

**Tool:** `search_knowledge`

Find notes by meaning, not just exact words. Uses hybrid search (keyword + semantic vector search) by default, so it finds conceptually related content even when the exact phrasing differs.

```
Find everything I know about distributed systems.
Search for notes about anxiety.
What did I save about Rust's ownership model?
Find articles related to sleep and productivity.
```

Search modes: `hybrid` (default), `keyword`, or `semantic`.

---

#### Link notes

**Tool:** `link_notes`

Create a bidirectional connection between two notes. Useful for building a knowledge graph.

```
Link note abc-123 to note xyz-456.
Connect the "Redis caching" note to the "API design" note.
```

---

#### Categorize a note

**Tool:** `categorize_note`

Ask the agent to automatically categorize an existing note using AI — assigns a category and tags, and in `full` mode also generates a summary, key points, and a one-line gist.

```
Categorize note abc-123.
Auto-tag this note and generate a summary.
Run full processing on note xyz-456.
```

Modes: `lightweight` (category + tags only) and `full` (category + tags + summary + gist + key points).

---

#### Mark content status

**Tool:** `mark_content`

Track whether you've read, consumed, or archived a note or saved article.

```
Mark note abc-123 as read.
Archive that article — I'm done with it.
I've read the Redis docs, mark them as read.
```

Statuses: `saved` (unread, default), `read` (consumed), `archived` (hidden from search).

---

### Todos & Reminders

EchOS distinguishes two kinds of time-management items stored in the same underlying table:

| Kind | Description | Due date |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **todo** | Action item to do — no specific time required | Optional |
| **reminder** | Time-anchored item — will trigger a notification when due | Required |

EchOS auto-detects todos: if your message contains first-person intent ("I need to…", "I should…", "remember to…") it will silently capture a todo before responding.

#### Add a reminder or todo

**Tool:** `add_reminder`

Use `kind="todo"` for action items; use `kind="reminder"` (or omit) for time-based reminders. If the scheduler is enabled, reminders will send a notification when due.

```
Remind me to review the PR tomorrow at 10am.
Add a high-priority reminder: renew SSL cert by March 1st.
I need to call the dentist.
```

---

#### List todos

**Tool:** `list_todos`

Show your todo list. Returns **only todos** — never mixes in reminders or notes.

```
Show my todo list.
What tasks do I have pending?
What have I already done?
```

---

#### List reminders

**Tool:** `list_reminders`

See your time-based pending (or completed) reminders.

```
What are my open reminders?
What do I have due this week?
```

---

#### Complete a reminder or todo

**Tool:** `complete_reminder`

Mark any reminder or todo as done by id.

```
Mark reminder abc-123 as done.
I've completed that dentist task.
```

---

### Memory

#### Remember something about you

**Tool:** `remember_about_me`

Store a fact, preference, or detail about yourself in long-term memory. EchOS will use this in future conversations without you having to repeat it.

```
Remember that I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript.
I'm allergic to peanuts — save that.
Note that I'm working on a startup in the fintech space.
I prefer concise responses without bullet points.
```

Kinds: `fact`, `person`, `project`, `expertise`, `preference`.

---

#### Recall what EchOS knows about you

**Tool:** `recall_knowledge`

Ask EchOS to surface everything it remembers about a topic or about you.

```
What do you know about my tech preferences?
Recall everything about my work projects.
What have I told you about my health?
```

---

### Conversation

#### Save conversation

**Tool:** `save_conversation`

Save a summary of the current conversation as a note — useful after a productive discussion you want to preserve.

```
Save this conversation.
Save a summary of what we discussed about the API design.
Note down what we figured out today.
```

---

### Export

#### Export notes or content

**Tool:** `export_notes`

Export stored notes — or any piece of content, including agent responses and analysis results — as a downloadable file. Delivered directly in Telegram (as a document attachment), the CLI (stdout or `--output`), or the Web interface (as a download link).

```
Export note abc-123 as markdown.
Export all my notes tagged "recipes" as a zip.
Export everything I have about Redis as JSON.
Export that analysis you just did as a text file.
Export this conversation as a markdown file.
```

Formats:
| Format | Extension | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `markdown` | `.md` | Single notes with frontmatter intact |
| `text` | `.txt` | Plain readable text, markdown syntax stripped |
| `json` | `.json` | Structured data with metadata |
| `zip` | `.zip` | Multiple notes bundled together |

You can also export arbitrary content — agent responses, analysis results, or anything from the current conversation — by just asking for it.

---

### Voice & personality

#### Set agent voice

**Tool:** `set_agent_voice`

Change how EchOS talks to you — tone, warmth, verbosity, formality, personality. Takes effect immediately and persists across sessions.

```
Be more concise.
Be warmer and more encouraging.
Use a formal, professional tone.
Be playful, use light humour.
Reset your voice to default.
```

See [Writing & Voice](/WRITING) for the full guide.

---

## Plugin tools

Plugins extend EchOS with additional capabilities. Enable them via config.

---

### Article plugin

#### Save a web article

**Tool:** `save_article`

Fetch any URL, extract the article content (using Mozilla Readability), and save it as a note. Strips ads, navigation, and boilerplate — keeps the actual content.

```
Save this article: https://example.com/post
Save and auto-categorize: https://example.com/post
```

Optional: `autoCategorize` (runs AI categorization on save), `processingMode` (`lightweight` or `full`).

---

### YouTube plugin

#### Save a YouTube video

**Tool:** `save_youtube`

Extract the transcript from a YouTube video and save it as a note. Great for preserving content from talks, tutorials, and interviews.

```
Save this video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=...
Save and summarize this talk: https://youtu.be/...
```

Optional: `autoCategorize`, `processingMode`.

---

### Image plugin

#### Save an image

**Tool:** `save_image`

Save an image to your knowledge base — via URL or by sending the image directly. Extracts metadata (dimensions, format, EXIF data) and optionally runs AI analysis.

```
Save this image: https://example.com/photo.jpg
[send image in Telegram] Save this with the tag "inspiration"
Analyze and save this screenshot.
```

On Telegram, you can just send an image and ask EchOS to save it.

---

### Content-creation plugin

#### Write content in your voice

**Tool:** `create_content`

Generate long-form content that sounds like *you* — blog posts, articles, threads, emails, essays, and tutorials. Uses your style profile (built from voice examples you curate) and pulls relevant notes from your knowledge base as context.

```
Write a blog post about burnout in tech.
Draft a Twitter thread about Rust's memory model.
Write an email to my team about the Q2 roadmap.
Write a tutorial on setting up LanceDB.
```

Content types: `blog_post`, `article`, `thread`, `email`, `essay`, `tutorial`

You can also specify: length, audience, and extra instructions.

See [Writing & Voice](/WRITING) for the full guide.

---

#### Analyze your writing style

**Tool:** `analyze_my_style`

Build a detailed profile of your writing voice from pieces you've curated as examples. Run this after you've tagged at least 5 notes as voice examples.

```
Analyze my writing style.
Re-analyze my style — I've added new examples.
```

---

#### View your style profile

**Tool:** `get_style_profile`

Display your current writing style profile — tone descriptors, vocabulary characteristics, sentence patterns, formality level, and sample paragraphs.

```
Show me my style profile.
What have you learned about how I write?
```

---

#### Mark a voice example

**Tool:** `mark_as_voice_example`

Tag a note as a voice example so it gets included in style analysis. Best with polished, representative writing of 500+ words.

```
Mark note abc-123 as a voice example.
Tag my "distributed systems post" as a voice example.
```

---

### Digest plugin

The digest plugin runs as a scheduled background job (not a direct tool). It generates a summary of recent notes and broadcasts it to your configured notification channel (Telegram).

Configure it via the scheduler:

```
Schedule a daily digest at 8am.
Send me a weekly digest every Sunday.
```
